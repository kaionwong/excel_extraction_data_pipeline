# Objectives
This repo handles data extraction and standardization from Excel files without consistent naming systems in data column and individual Excel worksheet. This executes with looping at various levels including location, year, all Excel files within the folders, all Excel worksheets within each Excel file, and rows from each worksheet. The worksheet names may include single month, single quarter, multiple months, or no month/quarter (or time) reference. The script will automatically extract the corresponding quarter if one exists from the worksheet name. Otherwise if no time reference in the worksheet, it will search all the rows in the worksheet above the header (or column name) row, and attempt to extract a quarter reference.
